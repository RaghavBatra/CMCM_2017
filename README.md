## More information on the below is contained in the manuscript
* *route_10_0* and *route_10_5* are folders that contain graphs of battery consumption, fuel consumption and electric consumption
* *routes_csv_data* is a folder that contains the elevation data for each route in a CSV format
* *slope* is a folder that computes the elevation slope for each route, stored as a CSV
* *smoothing_elev_vs_dist* is a folder that contains the smoothened slope: elev_profile_smooth_10/17 are images of such plots
* *find_and_smoothen_slope.m* is a MATLAB script that smoothens the initial data
* *find_optimal.m* is a MATLAB script to solve the bus allocation problem using linear programming
